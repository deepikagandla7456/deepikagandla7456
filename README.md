### 🐍 Contribution Snake

In GitHub, Achievements and the Activity Graph are two different things. Here is a clear explanation of both and how to get them:

1. What are Achievements?

Looking at Yogesh's profile, the Achievements are the small badges on the left sidebar (like the shark, the cat, and the gold medal).

How to get them: You cannot "code" these. GitHub awards them to you automatically when you perform certain actions.

Pull Shark: Merging Pull Requests.

Quickdraw: Closing an issue or PR within minutes of opening it.

YOLO: Merging a Pull Request without a review.

Arctic Code Vault: Having code in a repository that was part of GitHub's 2020 archive.

How to show them: They will appear on your left sidebar automatically as soon as you earn them.

2. How to include the Radar Graph (Activity Overview)

The graph you see in Yogesh's profile that shows "Commits, Pull Requests, Issues, and Code Reviews" is called an Activity Overview Radar Chart.

To include this exact graph in your profile, copy and paste this code into your README.md file:

code
Markdown
download
content_copy
expand_less

</p>
3. How to include the "Top Contributed Repo" Grid

Yogesh also has a green grid specifically for one repository. This is usually done using a tool called GitHub Readme Streak Stats or a specific repository contribution tracker.

However, for a student profile, the Radar Chart (provided above) is much more professional because it shows that you are a "Balanced Developer" who doesn't just write code, but also participates in discussions and reviews.

Final "Placement Pro" Tip:

Recruiters love the Radar Chart because it proves you are active in all areas of development.

Where to put it: Place the code I gave you right above your "GitHub Stats" and "Top Languages" section. It will create a professional "Dashboard" look that managers find very impressive during hiring.

Note: If the graph appears as a broken image for the first few minutes, don't worry. The server is simply generating the chart for the first time. Refresh after 5 minutes and it will be there!
